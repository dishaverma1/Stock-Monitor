## Using TickerTape

To use TickerTape, follow these steps:

1. Play Button: On click of the play button, the app starts fetching latest data every 5 seconds and recording the result of each stock. If the app is already in play mode it will go in pause mode and stop fetching and recording the prices. 
2. History Button: On click of the history button the app redirects to the History page of the most expensive stock(the highest price) as per the last received API response. 
3. On clicking on a particular listed stock, the app navigates to the HISTORY page for that stock.

HISTORY page has two sections: 
1) Current Price: This section shows the latest price, with the absolute change and percentage change.  
2) Chart: This section is a line graph with time (based on the time you fetched the data from API) on the x-axis and price(in Rs.) on the y-axis. The chart is drawn using the history of prices recorded when the app has been in play mode for this particular stock. If the app has never been in play mode, the chart should be empty.
